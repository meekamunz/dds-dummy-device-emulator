SCRIPT TASKS
1. read excel file
2. filter out DDS devices (Device Type, column D = GVOP)
3. create devices (1x per GUID, use name (column C) and IP addresses (IP A = column E==A + column K, IP B = column E==B + column K)).  Assume link speed is 25GB (25000).  Set number of sources and dests (read numbers of spigots from Source and Dest ports pages per device)
4. create source spigots for the device (use source flows page for data, type = column F, mcast = column J, unicast = column K, src port = column M, dest port = column L, flow_id = column G, caps should be set via flow type)
5. create dest spigots (no export of dest flows, we know how many spigots to create based on info in #3, we should assume that the dest spigot config matches the source spigots eg number of flows per spigot etc)
